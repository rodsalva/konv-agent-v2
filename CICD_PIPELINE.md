# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the MCP Agent Backend. The pipeline automates testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring code quality and streamlining the development workflow.

## Pipeline Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of several workflows:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**
   - Linting and Type Checking
   - Unit Testing
   - Building

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Database Schema Setup
   - Integration Tests

3. **Code Quality**
   - ESLint Reporting
   - Code Duplication Detection
   - Code Coverage Analysis

4. **Security Scanning**
   - Dependency Vulnerability Checks

5. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
   - Staging Deployment
   - Production Deployment

## Workflow Triggers

Each workflow is triggered by specific events:

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| CI | Push to `main`, `dev`; Pull requests | Verify code quality and functionality |
| Integration Tests | Push to `main`, `dev`; Pull requests; Manual | Verify system integration |
| Code Quality | Push to `main`, `dev`; Pull requests; Weekly schedule | In-depth code analysis |
| Dependency Check | Push to `main`, `dev`; Pull requests; Weekly schedule | Security vulnerability detection |
| CD - Staging | Push to `main` | Deploy to staging environment |
| CD - Production | Push of a tag (`v*`) | Deploy to production environment |

## Environments

The pipeline supports multiple deployment environments:

### Staging
- Purpose: Testing and validation before production
- Trigger: Automatic deployment on push to `main` branch
- Database: Staging database with test data

### Production
- Purpose: Live environment for end users
- Trigger: Manual deployment via version tags
- Database: Production database with real data

## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment
1. Code is pushed to the `main` branch
2. CI workflow runs and verifies the code
3. If CI passes, the CD workflow deploys to staging
4. Database migrations are applied if needed
5. Application is restarted with new code

### Production Deployment
1. A new version tag is created (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. CI workflow runs and verifies the code
3. If CI passes, the CD workflow deploys to production
4. Database migrations are applied if needed
5. Application is restarted with new code
6. A GitHub release is created

## Database Migrations

Database migrations are managed as part of the deployment process:

1. Migration SQL files are stored in the repository
2. Migrations are applied automatically during deployment
3. For Docker deployment, migrations are mounted as initialization scripts

## Security Considerations

The CI/CD pipeline includes several security measures:

1. **Secret Management**
   - Sensitive information stored as GitHub Secrets
   - No credentials in the repository or Docker images

2. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Regular checks for dependency vulnerabilities
   - Automatic pull requests for security updates via Dependabot

3. **Access Control**
   - Restricted access to deployment environments
   - Separation between staging and production

## Monitoring and Logging

After deployment, the system is monitored for any issues:

1. Health checks verify the application is running correctly
2. Logs are collected and analyzed for errors
3. Performance metrics are tracked

## Rollback Procedure

If a deployment causes issues, the system can be rolled back:

1. **Automatic Rollback**
   - Failed deployments trigger automatic rollback

2. **Manual Rollback**
   - Previous version can be redeployed manually
   - Database can be restored if needed

## Best Practices

When working with the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Branch Strategy**
   - Use feature branches for development
   - Create pull requests to `dev` branch
   - Merge `dev` to `main` for staging deployment
   - Create version tags for production deployment

2. **Commit Messages**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Reference issue numbers when applicable

3. **Testing**
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Run tests locally before pushing

4. **Code Reviews**
   - All pull requests should be reviewed
   - CI should pass before merging

## Pipeline Customization

The CI/CD pipeline can be customized by editing the workflow files:

1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
2. `.github/workflows/integration-test.yml`
3. `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`
4. `.github/workflows/dependency-check.yml`
5. `.github/workflows/cd.yml`

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Failed CI Checks**
   - Check the workflow logs for details
   - Fix the issues and push again

2. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check the deployment logs
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check database migrations

3. **Integration Test Failures**
   - Verify database schema
   - Check test data
   - Ensure services are running

## Conclusion

The CI/CD pipeline automates the testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring high-quality code and reliable deployments. By following the documented best practices, developers can contribute to the project efficiently and with confidence.
