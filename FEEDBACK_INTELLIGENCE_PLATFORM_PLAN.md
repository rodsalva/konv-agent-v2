# Feedback Intelligence Platform - Complete Architecture Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for building a feedback intelligence platform using agent-to-agent (A2A) communication with human oversight. The platform leverages AI-powered personas to simulate diverse customer segments, providing structured, consistent, and actionable feedback across e-commerce platforms with concrete business impact projections.

## 1. Platform Overview

### Vision
Create an AI-native feedback intelligence platform where specialized AI agents adopt diverse customer personas to collect, analyze, and distribute insights while maintaining human oversight and control.

### Core Objectives
- **Multi-Persona Simulation**: Deploy diverse AI personas to capture varied customer perspectives
- **Structured Feedback Collection**: Ensure consistent, comparable data across personas. You can ask follow-up / contextual questions, but always make sure that there are at least 3 core comparable questions that you ask within a survey to all respondents. 
- **Department-Specific Insights**: Transform raw feedback into actionable business recommendations (don't try to calculate ROIs and effort)
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Comprehensive oversight and control mechanisms
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle thousands of feedback interactions daily

## 2. Agent Communication Protocols & Standards

### Primary Protocol: Agent2Agent (A2A)
Based on Google's A2A protocol for cross-platform agent interoperability:

**Why A2A:**
- Industry-backed standard (50+ partners including Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow)
- Built on familiar web standards (HTTP, JSON-RPC 2.0, SSE)
- Vendor and framework agnostic
- Supports complex multi-turn interactions
- Enterprise-grade security and authentication

**A2A Implementation Components:**
```yaml
Agent Cards:
  - Public metadata at /.well-known/agent.json
  - Capability discovery and negotiation
  - Authentication requirements
  - Supported skills and operations

Message Structure:
  - Structured multi-part messages
  - Support for text, binary, and JSON data
  - Conversation threading and context
  - Task lifecycle management

Communication Patterns:
  - Synchronous request-response
  - Asynchronous long-running tasks
  - Real-time streaming via SSE
  - Push notifications for status updates
```

### Secondary Protocol: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
For tool and data source integration:

**Why MCP as Complement:**
- Standardizes tool/API access for agents
- Secure context injection and structured data exchange
- Handles Resources, Tools, Prompts, and Sampling
- Growing ecosystem of MCP servers

### Communication Architecture
```
┌─────────────────┐    A2A     ┌─────────────────┐
│  Company Agent  │ ◄─────────► │ Persona Agent   │
└─────────────────┘            └─────────────────┘
         │                               │
         │ MCP                          │ MCP
         ▼                               ▼
┌─────────────────┐            ┌─────────────────┐
│   Tool Server   │            │   Data Source   │
└─────────────────┘            └─────────────────┘
```

## 3. Multi-Agent Framework Selection

### Primary Framework: LangGraph
**Rationale:**
- Production-ready (used by Replit and other enterprises)
- Excellent for complex multi-agent workflows
- Strong streaming and real-time capabilities
- Native support for cycles and controllability
- Automatic state persistence

### Secondary Frameworks:
- **CrewAI**: For specialized collaborative workflows
- **AutoGen/AG2**: For academic research and experimentation
- **Agno**: For rapid prototyping and development

### Agent Framework Integration Strategy
```python
# Example: LangGraph agent with A2A wrapper
class PersonaFeedbackAgent:
    def __init__(self, persona_type="tech_enthusiast"):
        self.persona_type = persona_type
        self.langgraph_agent = create_langgraph_agent()
        self.a2a_adapter = A2AAdapter(self.langgraph_agent)
        self.mcp_client = MCPClient()
    
    async def provide_feedback(self, product_data, questions):
        # Use MCP for tool access
        context = await self.mcp_client.get_context(product_data)
        
        # Process with LangGraph using persona-specific parameters
        result = await self.langgraph_agent.process(
            context, 
            persona=self.persona_type
        )
        
        # Return via A2A
        return await self.a2a_adapter.respond(result)
```

## 6. Department-Specific Insight Generation

### 6.1 Specific, Actionable Insight Requirements

All insights generated by the platform must adhere to the following standards to ensure they deliver concrete, implementable value. Insights must identify both strengths to maintain and specific issues to address.

**Insight Quality Requirements:**
- **Specific, not general**: Each insight must identify a precise aspect of the platform rather than broad observations
- **Evidence-based**: All insights must reference specific feedback or data points from persona interactions
- **Actionable**: Must include clear path to implementation, not just identification of issues
- **Measurable**: Must include how success will be determined after implementation
- **Cross-validated**: Verified across multiple personas or data points when possible

**Insight Structure:**
```yaml
Structure:
  - Specific observation (what exactly is working/not working)
  - Supporting evidence (direct quotes, metrics, specific examples)
  - Root cause analysis (why this is happening)
  - Concrete recommendation (exactly what should be done)
  - Expected outcome (what will improve if implemented)
  - Verification method (how to measure success)
```

#### Product Development Insights Examples

**✅ GOOD (Specific & Actionable):**
```yaml
Issue: The product comparison tool fails to highlight key differences between similar smartphone models
Evidence: 
  - Tech Enthusiast Persona reported: "When comparing the Samsung Galaxy S25 and S25+, the side-by-side view doesn't highlight the RAM difference (8GB vs 12GB) visually, forcing me to carefully read each spec line."
  - 78% of tech personas took >45 seconds to identify key differences between similar models
Root Cause: The comparison UI treats all specifications with equal visual weight rather than highlighting differentiating features
Solution: Implement visual highlighting of differing specifications in comparison tables with color coding and delta indicators
Expected Outcome: Reduce time to identify key differences between products by 50%
Verification: A/B test with eye-tracking analysis and time-to-decision metrics
```

**❌ BAD (Too Vague):**
```yaml
Issue: Product comparison needs improvement
Evidence: Users struggle with comparisons
Root Cause: UI is confusing
Solution: Make comparisons better
Expected Outcome: Improved user experience
Verification: Check if users like it
```

**Working Well Example:**
```yaml
Strength: The detailed specification display for technical products is comprehensive and well-structured
Evidence:
  - Tech Enthusiast Persona praised: "The technical specification sections are incredibly detailed. I can find exact RAM, processor type, and graphics card information in a consistent format across products."
  - 92% of tech personas found all required specifications without needing to consult external sources
  - Time spent on specification pages is 2.3x longer than category pages, indicating high engagement
Success Factors: Standardized specification format, manufacturer-verified data, technical terminology consistency
Recommendation: Maintain current format while expanding to include benchmark scores for performance-oriented categories
Verification: Track external reference searches during shopping journey (lower is better)
```

#### Marketing Insights Examples

**✅ GOOD (Specific & Actionable):**
```yaml
Issue: Budget-conscious customers are unaware of the installment payment options until checkout
Evidence:
  - Budget Shopper Persona stated: "I almost abandoned my purchase of the R$1,299 vacuum because I thought I had to pay the full amount upfront. I only discovered the 12x payment option at the final checkout step."
  - 63% of budget personas expressed surprise when shown the installment options were available
  - Cart abandonment rate for items >R$500 is 34% higher than industry average
Root Cause: Payment options are only prominently displayed during checkout, not on product pages
Solution: Add "as low as R$XX/month" messaging to all product pages and search results for items over R$300
Expected Outcome: 15% reduction in cart abandonment for high-value items
Verification: A/B test cart abandonment rates with and without early payment option visibility
```

#### UX/UI Insights Examples

**✅ GOOD (Specific & Actionable):**
```yaml
Issue: Senior shoppers cannot easily locate the customer service contact options
Evidence:
  - Senior Shopper Persona reported: "I spent over 4 minutes trying to find a phone number to call about my order. The 'Help' link at the bottom of the page only led to FAQs, not direct contact options."
  - 89% of senior personas failed to locate phone support within 2 minutes
  - Heat map analysis shows seniors scanning the header and footer repeatedly looking for contact information
Root Cause: Contact information is nested 3 clicks deep within the Help Center rather than directly accessible
Solution: Add a persistent "Contact Us" button in the global header with direct access to phone, chat, and email options
Expected Outcome: Reduce time to locate contact options by 75% for all personas
Verification: Task completion time metrics for "find customer service phone number" user journey
```
